            <h1>Ryzen 7 7700X</h1>
            <p>AMD Ryzen 7 7700X is a desktop processor with 8 cores, launched in September 2022. It is part of the Ryzen 7 lineup, using the Zen 4 (Raphael) architecture with Socket AM5. Thanks to AMD Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) the core-count is effectively doubled, to 16 threads. Ryzen 7 7700X has 32MB of L3 cache and operates at 4.5 GHz by default, but can boost up to 5.4 GHz, depending on the workload. AMD is making the Ryzen 7 7700X on a 5 nm production node using 6,570 million transistors. The silicon die of the chip is not fabricated at AMD, but at the foundry of TSMC. You may freely adjust the unlocked multiplier on Ryzen 7 7700X, which simplifies overclocking greatly, as you can easily dial in any overclocking frequency.</p>
